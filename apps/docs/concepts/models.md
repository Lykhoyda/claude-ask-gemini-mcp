# Model Selection

Each provider auto-selects a sensible default model with automatic fallback to a lighter model on quota or availability errors. **Most users should never override the model parameter** — the defaults are tuned for quality and the fallback chain handles failures.

## Defaults & Fallbacks

| Provider | Default | Fallback | Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | `gemini-3-flash-preview` | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` quota error or "exhausted your capacity" pattern ([ADR-044](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/blob/main/docs/DECISIONS.md)) |
| Codex | `gpt-5.5` | `gpt-5.5-mini` | Quota errors (`rate_limit_exceeded`, `429`, `insufficient_quota`) ([ADR-028](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/blob/main/docs/DECISIONS.md), bumped per [ADR-067](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/blob/main/docs/DECISIONS.md)) |
| Ollama | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` | Model-not-found error (e.g., 7b not pulled but 1.5b is) |

The fallback fires automatically inside the executor — your client sees a successful response with `usage.fellBack: true` in the structured output, and a `[Gemini stats: ... fell back]` annotation in the formatted text.

## Choosing a Provider

Different providers excel at different things. Pick by what you're doing, not by which is "best":

| Task | Suggested provider | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Whole-codebase review | **Gemini** | 1M+ token context fits things others can't |
| Targeted code reasoning, refactor critique | **Codex** | GPT-5.5's strength is dense code reasoning at moderate context size |
| Private / air-gapped analysis | **Ollama** | Runs locally, nothing leaves your machine |
| "What do they all think?" comparison | **Multi-LLM** (`multi-llm` tool or `/compare` skill) | Parallel dispatch, see all responses side-by-side |
| Code review with verified findings | **`/multi-review` skill** | Gemini + Codex in parallel, then verifies each finding against source |

## Overriding the Model

Pass `model` explicitly when you have a reason to:

```text
Use ask-llm with provider gemini and model gemini-3-flash-preview to quickly check this CSS file
```

Or programmatically:

```json
{ "name": "ask-llm", "arguments": { "provider": "gemini", "model": "gemini-3-flash-preview", "prompt": "..." } }
```

For Codex, common overrides:

```text
Use ask-codex with model gpt-5.5-mini to summarize this commit
```

For Ollama, you can request any model you've pulled:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b
```

```text
Use ask-ollama with model deepseek-coder:6.7b to review this implementation
```

## Token Limits & Cost

| Provider | Context window | Cost model |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini Pro | ~1M tokens (~250k LOC) | Free tier via OAuth, paid tiers via API key |
| Gemini Flash | ~1M tokens | Cheaper than Pro; fallback target for quota relief |
| Codex GPT-5.5 | Per OpenAI's published context window | Per OpenAI billing |
| Codex GPT-5.5-mini | Smaller context | Cheaper; fallback target |
| Ollama | Per model (e.g., 32k for qwen2.5-coder) | Free — runs locally |

## Track What You're Spending

Token usage is exposed live via:

- **Per-call**: `result.structuredContent.usage` on every `ask-*` tool response (provider, model, inputTokens, outputTokens, cachedTokens, thinkingTokens, durationMs, fellBack) — see [ADR-054](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/blob/main/docs/DECISIONS.md)
- **Per-session aggregate**: call the `get-usage-stats` MCP tool, or read the `usage://current-session` MCP Resource for a JSON snapshot
- **In the REPL**: type `/usage` for a markdown-formatted breakdown

This is in-memory only — no persistence to disk, resets when the MCP server restarts.

## Recommendations by Use Case

- **General code review** → defaults are correct; let the fallback chain handle quota
- **Whole-codebase analysis** → `ask-gemini` (Pro) — Flash auto-kicks in if Pro is exhausted
- **Quick fixes, fast iteration** → request Flash or `gpt-5.5-mini` explicitly to skip the Pro→fallback round-trip
- **Privacy-sensitive code** → `ask-ollama`, never leaves your machine
- **Multi-perspective debate** → `multi-llm` or `/brainstorm` skill — Claude weighs verified vs inferred
