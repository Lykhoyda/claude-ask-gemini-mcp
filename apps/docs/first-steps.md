description: Verify your Ask LLM setup, send your first prompt to any provider, and explore multi-provider parallel dispatch.

# First Steps

Once installed, here's how to confirm everything works and start using Ask LLM.

## Test the Connection

```text
Use ask-llm ping to test the connection
```

You should see a `Pong!` reply listing the providers your server detected.

If something's off, run the doctor from your terminal — it works even when the MCP server can't start:

```bash
npx ask-llm-mcp doctor
```

## Single-Provider Calls

The unified `ask-llm` tool takes a `provider` parameter. In natural language:

```text
Use ask-llm to ask Gemini to explain @src/auth.ts
Use ask-llm to ask Codex how to refactor this function
Use ask-llm to ask Ollama to summarize this file (runs locally, no data sent anywhere)
```

If you installed the per-provider packages instead of the orchestrator, the tools are named explicitly:

```text
ask gemini to summarize @README.md
ask codex to review the staged changes
ask ollama to explain this auth flow
```

## Multi-Provider Dispatch

Send the same prompt to multiple providers in one call and compare:

```text
Use multi-llm to ask Gemini and Codex whether this approach is thread-safe
```

Returns per-provider responses + token usage in one structured payload. Per-provider failures are isolated (one provider hitting quota doesn't fail the whole call).

## Multi-Turn Conversations

Every response includes a session ID. Pass it back to continue:

```text
Use ask-llm to ask Gemini to review @src/auth.ts for security issues
# → Response includes [Session ID: abc-123-...]

Use ask-llm to ask Gemini to fix the XSS issue you found, sessionId abc-123-...
# → Gemini remembers the prior review
```

All three providers support sessions — Gemini and Codex use native CLI resume, Ollama uses server-side conversation replay. See [Multi-Turn Sessions](/usage/multi-turn-sessions) for details.

## Interactive REPL

For quick sanity checks without setting up an MCP client:

```bash
npx ask-llm-mcp repl
```

Multi-provider shell with `/provider <name>`, `/new`, `/usage`, `/sessions`, `/help`, `/quit` slash commands. Streams Gemini responses live.
