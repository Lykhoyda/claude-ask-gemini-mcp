# Pause codex-pair for this project

Pauses the codex-pair hook for the current project without removing the `.codex-pair-context.md` marker. The marker (and its project context) stays in place — only the temporary pause sentinel is written. Resume with `/codex-pair-resume`.

## When to use

- Starting a noisy refactor where every edit would surface concerns you've already decided to accept
- Working on docs/comments/typos where review adds no value
- Dogfooding the hook itself (avoid recursive self-reviews)
- Burning down a known-issues list where you don't want codex re-flagging them on every save

For permanent disable, remove the `.codex-pair-context.md` marker instead. For per-file/per-directory opt-out, use `.codex-pair-ignore` (gitignore-style globs).

## Instructions

1. Locate the `.codex-pair-context.md` marker by walking up from the current working directory. If no marker is found, inform the user: "codex-pair is not enabled in this project (no `.codex-pair-context.md` marker found). Nothing to pause."

2. Create the pause sentinel:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p <marker-dir>/.codex-pair-state
   touch <marker-dir>/.codex-pair-state/paused
   ```
   Replace `<marker-dir>` with the directory containing the marker.

3. Confirm to the user with the marker directory path:
   ```
   codex-pair paused for <marker-dir>
   Resume with /codex-pair-resume (or `rm <marker-dir>/.codex-pair-state/paused`)
   ```

4. If `.gitignore` in the marker directory does not already contain `.codex-pair-state/`, mention it as a suggestion (do not modify the user's .gitignore without asking).
