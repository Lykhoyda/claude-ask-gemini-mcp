// Cross-platform process-tree termination (extracted from codex-pair-watch.mjs

// POSIX: spawn with `detached: true` so the child becomes a process-group
// leader; signal `-pid` to deliver to every member. Windows: `taskkill /F /T`
// terminates the entire tree (Windows has no POSIX process groups).
//
// `detached: true` does NOT detach the child's lifecycle — that requires
// child.unref(). We deliberately skip unref() so the parent waits for the
// child as normal.
