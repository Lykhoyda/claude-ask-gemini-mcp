### Patch Changes

- [#111](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/pull/111) [`ab40290`](https://github.com/Lykhoyda/ask-llm/commit/ab40290fecdbabec75436579d06152f6218251d6) Thanks [@Lykhoyda](https://github.com/Lykhoyda)! - # v0.7.0 family sync — synchronized MCP-package patch bump

  The MCP server packages (`ask-gemini-mcp`, `ask-codex-mcp`, `ask-ollama-mcp`,
  `ask-llm-mcp`) are unchanged in code since the prior release (v1.6.4 / v0.3.x —
  `git diff v1.6.4..main -- packages/shared packages/gemini-mcp packages/codex-mcp
packages/ollama-mcp packages/llm-mcp` returns empty). They are patch-bumped here
  to keep the gemini-codex-ollama-llm family aligned on the same SHA-stamped release
  moment that ships the v0.7.0 plugin work (Tier 3 broker + ADR-092/094/095/096/097
  codex-pair improvements — all inside the private `@ask-llm/plugin` package).

  This preserves the unified-tag convention from the original gemini-mcp-tool fork
  (legacy v1.5.x..v1.6.x URLs still resolve at `v<gemini_version>`) and gives npm
  consumers a single discoverable release moment instead of a v0.7.0 plugin-only
  event with no npm-visible artifact.

  No functional changes in these packages. Tests, type contracts, executor
  behavior, MCP tool surface — all byte-identical to the prior release.
