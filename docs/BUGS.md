# Bug Reports

## Known Bugs (inherited from upstream)

### ~~Deprecated `-p` flag causes error~~ FIXED
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Upstream:** Issue #48, PRs #56, #43
- **Description:** Gemini CLI v0.23+ deprecated the `-p`/`--prompt` flag. Using it now produces "Cannot use both positional prompt and --prompt flag" error.
- **Fix:** Replaced `-p` flag with `--` separator + positional argument in `geminiExecutor.ts`

### ~~Windows ENOENT spawn errors~~ FIXED
- **Severity:** High
- **Upstream:** Issues #28, #30, #40; PRs #23, #27, #41, #43
- **Description:** `child_process.spawn()` fails on Windows because `gemini` resolves to `gemini.cmd`. Needs `shell: true` option and proper argument escaping.
- **Fix:** Added `shell: process.platform === "win32"` in `commandExecutor.ts`

### ~~Exit code 42: "No input provided via stdin"~~ FIXED
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Affected versions:** Gemini CLI v0.29.5+
- **Description:** After ADR-006 switched from `-p` flag to `--` separator for prompt passing, Gemini CLI v0.29.5 changed behavior so that positional arguments (via `--`) launch interactive mode expecting stdin. Since the MCP server spawns Gemini with `stdio: ["ignore", ...]`, stdin is closed and Gemini exits with code 42.
- **Fix:** Reverted to `-p` flag (`CLI.FLAGS.PROMPT = "-p"`) which triggers non-interactive headless mode. The v0.23 deprecation of `-p` was reversed in v0.29. See ADR-015.

### ~~Excessive token responses~~ WON'T FIX
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Upstream:** Issues #6, #26
- **Description:** MCP tool responses can exceed 45k tokens even for small prompts, consuming excessive context window.
- **Root cause:** Model-specific bug in `gemini-2.5-pro` — always returned ~45,735 tokens regardless of prompt size. Does not affect `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (current default) or Flash models.
- **Mitigation:** Default model changed to `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Gemini CLI has no `--max-output-tokens` flag, so server-side truncation would be the only option — deemed unnecessary since the affected model is no longer the default.

### Missing changelog for v1.1.4
- **Severity:** Low
- **Upstream:** Issue #39
- **Description:** Published version has no release notes or changelog entry.

## Bugs Found via Code Review Experiment (ADR-024)

### ~~extractJson greedy first-match~~ FIXED
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Description:** `extractJson` returned the first valid JSON object found in Gemini CLI output, even if it was debug output (e.g., `{"retry":true}`) rather than the actual Gemini response. This could cause silent data loss when CLI debug lines contain JSON objects before the real response.
- **Fix:** After `JSON.parse` succeeds, check if parsed object has `response` or `error` field (Gemini-shaped). If not, save as fallback and continue searching. Return fallback only if no Gemini-shaped JSON found.

### ~~extractJson escape outside strings~~ FIXED
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** The `extractJson` parser tracked escape sequences (`\`) globally, not just inside JSON strings. A backslash in prefix text (e.g., Windows paths like `C:\new\file`) would set `escapeNext = true`, causing the next character to be skipped and corrupting brace/quote tracking.
- **Fix:** Changed escape detection from `if (char === "\\")` to `if (inString && char === "\\")`.

### ~~Thinking tokens not displayed in stats footer~~ FIXED
- **Severity:** Low
- **Description:** The `GeminiModelTokens` interface included a `thoughts` field and the Gemini CLI returns thinking token counts, but `formatStats` never displayed them. Users had no visibility into how many thinking tokens Gemini used.
- **Fix:** Added `if (tokens.thoughts != null && tokens.thoughts > 0) parts.push(...)` to `formatStats`, displayed between output tokens and cached count.

## ~~Code Quality Issues (from utils/ audit)~~ ALL FIXED

All 10 code quality issues identified in the utils/ audit have been resolved:

- ~~No child process timeout~~ → Added 5min default timeout with SIGTERM→SIGKILL, configurable via `GMCPT_TIMEOUT_MS`
- ~~O(n^2) string concatenation~~ → Replaced with `Buffer[]` + `Buffer.concat()`
- ~~Broken @ symbol quoting~~ → Removed unnecessary quoting logic (`shell: false` means no shell expansion)
- ~~Raw Gemini output in error response~~ → Truncated to 2000 chars via `EXECUTION.ERROR_TRUNCATE_LENGTH`
- ~~Logger inconsistencies~~ → Removed `log()`, added level filtering, fixed `formatMessage`, `toolInvocation`, `toolParsedArgs`
- ~~Console.warn in changeModeParser~~ → Replaced with `Logger.warn`
- ~~Dead exported functions~~ → Deleted `summarizeChunking`, `getCacheStats`, `clearCache`
- ~~sendStatusMessage no-op~~ → Deleted, replaced call sites with `Logger.debug()`
- ~~processChangeModeOutput unnecessarily async~~ → Removed `async` keyword
