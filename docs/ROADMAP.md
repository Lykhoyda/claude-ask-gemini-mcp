# Roadmap

## Active plan: codex-pair stability hardening (2026-05-18)

Following the v0.6.0 batch and v0.6.1 / v0.6.2 patches, the next ship cadence is **driven by stability**, informed by:

- Multi-provider brainstorm of `openai/codex-plugin-cc` patterns (Gemini + Codex + Claude Opus).
- Multi-review of the resulting plan that revoked one recommendation (Stop hook migration — invalidated by our own ADR-048) and promoted the fake-codex fixture from Tier 3 to Tier 1.

**Sequencing for v0.6.3 → v0.7.0+:**

1. **v0.6.3 — Tier 1 hardening (no architectural decision required):** fake-codex test fixture, SKILL.md docs-drift fix, structured JSON output contract (replaces regex parser), cross-platform process-tree termination, atomic state writes audit.
2. **v0.6.4–v0.7.0 — Tier 2 (ADR-required):** PostToolUse debounce/coalesce (replaces dropped Stop migration), targeted `lib/` extraction (3-5 files), prompt template externalization with golden tests, app-server broker + SessionStart/SessionEnd lifecycle.
3. **v0.7.0+ — Tier 3 (defer):** health-check helpers, persistent job state, model aliases.

Full design + per-item effort estimates + ADR dependencies + verified empirical basis: [`docs/plans/2026-05-18-codex-plugin-cc-adoption-roadmap.md`](plans/2026-05-18-codex-plugin-cc-adoption-roadmap.md).

**ADRs to author during this work:** ADR-083 (output contract), ADR-084 (debounce semantics), ADR-085 (module boundary policy), ADR-086 (broker transport + lifecycle).

### Recently shipped (post-Tier 2 follow-ons)

- **ADR-092 — Consolidated `.codex-pair/` directory layout** (PR #92, 2026-05-19). All hook state (marker, log, ignore globs, cache, pause sentinel, inflight locks) nests under a single `.codex-pair/` directory; `.gitignore` collapses from 4 enumerated entries to 1; path-resolver pattern in `lib/state.mjs` is the single source of truth so future state files require no consumer changes. No migration helper per maintainer direction. Byte-identical behavior to v0.6.7 — cache, log shape, broker interface, atomicity contracts all unchanged.
- **Docs refinement for codex-pair communication** (PR #93, 2026-05-19). Six brainstorm-driven copy/structural improvements across README, hooks.md, overview.md, skills.md, and SKILL.md: inlined the empirical 2/10 → 7/10 → 10/10 benchmark numbers (previously buried behind an ADR-077 hyperlink); removed `codex-pair` from Skills tables (it's a hook, not a slash command) and replaced with a redirect callout; added per-developer / do-not-commit guidance to README; reordered hooks.md to put decision-frame before mechanics; reconciled $0.04–0.07/file cost across all surfaces (resolving a SKILL.md $0.20/edit-pass contradiction Claude alone caught in cross-surface review); broadened marker-context placeholder to categorized concrete invariants (Security/Specs/State/Concurrency).

- See [design doc](plans/2026-02-26-ask-llm-mcp-design.md)

## Priority 9: Bug Fixes (GitHub Issues)
- [x] **codex-pair v0.6.0 umbrella release — 10 hardening/observability/speed/DX improvements under one version bump** — Bump-first release model: PR #64 set the manifests to v0.6.0 with no code, then 7 implementation PRs (#66 bundled phase 1; #67–#72 sequential phase 2 + parallelizable phase 3) shipped under that umbrella without further bumps. (1) Log rotation at 2MB/1000 entries via atomic tmp-write+rename in `appendLog`; (2) structured run-state verdicts (`none | concerns | skipped | error | spawn_failed | timeout | parse_failed | cached | retried`), mirrored into the `systemMessage` prefix; (3) expanded skip patterns (fonts, archives, sourcemaps, snapshots, minified, lockfiles for pnpm/Cargo/Gemfile/composer/poetry/go); (4) default-model drift guard via new `packages/claude-plugin/codex-pair-defaults.json` + structural test linking values to `codex-mcp/src/constants.ts:MODELS`; (5) YAML frontmatter config in `.codex-pair-context.md` (model, fallbackModel, timeoutMs, maxFileBytes, surfaceThreshold) with hand-rolled zero-dep parser, precedence frontmatter > env > default; (6) adaptive context replaces over-cap silent-skip with three strategies — "diff" (header-80 + git diff -U20 HEAD for tracked files), "head-tail" (head-150 + omission + tail-80 for untracked / git-fail), "truncated" (for few-lines-but-huge-bytes); (7) `.codex-pair-ignore` with gitignore-style globs and `!` negation, silent log-only skip (NO systemMessage), preserves silent-gating UX; (8) content-hash response cache `sha256(model+prompt+fileContent+surfaceThreshold)` under `<markerDir>/.codex-pair-cache/<hash[0:2]>/<rest>.json`, 10min mtime TTL, 50-file LRU eviction, `[cached]` tag in systemMessage on hit; (9) standalone log viewer CLI `packages/claude-plugin/scripts/codex-pair-log.mjs` with `--latest [N]` / `--summary` / `--file <p>` / `--since <dur>` subcommands; (10) failure-class retry with jitter — transient errors (`ECONNRESET|ECONNREFUSED|ETIMEDOUT|EAI_AGAIN|UND_ERR|502\b|503\b|504\b`) retry once at `1000+rand*1500`ms, quota errors keep model-fallback path, timeout/parse_failed never retry. Marker file `.codex-pair-context.md` committed to dogfood the hook against this very codebase. Test count 141 → 194 (+53). ADRs 079 (frontmatter), 080 (adaptive context), 081 (ignore file), 082 (cache).
- [x] **codex-pair PostToolUse hook — recall-first complement to /codex-review (opt-in via marker file)** — The existing /codex-review skill is precision-first (confidence ≥80, "don't flag style/linter-catchable"), appropriate for routine PR review. A four-task benchmark on branch `experiment/codex-pair-poc` found that calibration structurally suppresses a specific class of bug: domain-level "wrong but won't crash" issues. Task 4's three-arm comparison was decisive — against the same Run-A natural-Claude shopping-cart code, /codex-review caught 7/10 differential probes; a recall-first per-file hook caught 10/10. The three missed probes were float-money precision, validation cross-cutting gap, and discount clamping — exactly the issues the confidence filter classifies as below threshold. New PostToolUse hook in `packages/claude-plugin/scripts/codex-pair-watch.mjs` self-gates on `.codex-pair-context.md` marker file (no marker = zero cost no-op; with marker = per-edit Codex review with HIGH/MED/LOW grading, surface HIGH+MED to Claude on next turn). Threshold lives in the hook, not the prompt, so it's tunable without re-asking codex to recalibrate. Coexists with /codex-review — explicit "when to use each" in the new `skills/codex-pair/SKILL.md`. Tests: 19 new in `src/__tests__/codex-pair-watch.test.ts` (13 structural + 6 runtime-behavior with synthesized stdin, no real codex calls). Plugin minor bump 0.3.1 → 0.3.2 via changesets. ADR-077
- [x] **Adopt Changesets + `changesets/action` for release automation** — Manual package.json edits + tag-push dance got us through v1.6.3 and v1.6.4 but failed twice: forgotten-bump tripwires on the bundled-deps cascade, and a week-stuck release when the SSH agent dropped between `main` push and `tag` push (motivated #52/#54 daily bot reports as "fix not landed"). Now mechanical: `yarn changeset` per PR queues a bump intent; bot auto-opens `chore: version packages` PR aggregating queued changesets; merging that PR triggers npm publish + MCP Registry + unified `v<gemini>` GitHub Release. Load-bearing config: `updateInternalDependents: "always"` forces the bundled-deps cascade to fire even when `workspace:*` always satisfies the range. Legacy v1.5.x..v1.6.x tag URLs preserved via custom unified-release step coexisting with changesets/action's per-package tags. CONTRIBUTING.md documents the new contributor flow. ADR-076
- [x] **#46 Upstream CLI compat — codex `--sandbox workspace-write` + gemini trust env-var co-emit** — Two upstream regressions our v1.6.3 shipped against: (1) codex 0.128 deprecates `--full-auto` (warning today, hard trap in 0.129-alpha); replaced with the canonical `--sandbox workspace-write` per codex's own deprecation message — `codex exec` is non-interactive by definition so approval-never is implicit. (2) gemini-cli main (→0.42) renamed `GEMINI_TRUST_WORKSPACE` to `GEMINI_CLI_TRUST_WORKSPACE` with no backward-compat alias, silently breaking ADR-069's auto-trust default once users upgrade. Co-emit both env-var names so one release covers any gemini-cli in current rotation without runtime version detection. Error message + README updated. Tests: codex assertion-shape updates in 3 places, gemini +1 escape-hatch test (99→100). Supersedes audit issues #41, #49, #50, #51. ADR-075
- [x] **#45 Per-provider timeouts — `ASK_CODEX_TIMEOUT_MS` / `ASK_GEMINI_TIMEOUT_MS` (codex default 800s)** — Long codex prompts with reasoning models routinely exceed the 210s global default; user reported timeout errors on substantive prompts that would have completed in ~300–600s. Added per-provider env-var override with codex-specific 800s default (gemini stays at 210s, ollama deferred since it goes via HTTP not subprocess). Resolution ladder: `ASK_{CODEX,GEMINI}_TIMEOUT_MS` > `GMCPT_TIMEOUT_MS` > provider default. Diagnose tool now surfaces both per-provider timeouts in its environment block. Forensic note in ADR-074: the issue's hypothesized "race between timer and close event with stats recorded post-hoc" is structurally impossible given current code (no streaming JSONL parser, no async usage tracker), so future contributors don't chase that dead end. Closes #45. ADR-074
- [x] **Codex `reasoning_output_tokens` plumbed through to shared `thinkingTokens`** — codex 0.125+ ships per-turn reasoning-token counts for `gpt-5.5` family; previously dropped on the floor (hard-coded `thinkingTokens: undefined`). Now mapped to the shared `UsageStats.thinkingTokens` field so cross-provider aggregation in `get-usage-stats` and `formatSessionUsage` works correctly across Gemini + Codex. `[Codex stats: ...]` footer now surfaces `"7,500 thinking tokens"` lines in the same position as Gemini. Drains P1 §2 from #28's punch list. ADR-072
- [x] **#32 Integration test for spawn env propagation** — Closes the coverage gap left by ADR-069's workspace-trust hotfix: existing trust-handling tests mock `executeCommand` directly, never exercising the real `process.env` → `getSpawnEnv()` → `spawn`'s `env` option chain. Added 3 real-spawn tests in `commandExecutor.test.ts` using `node -e "console.log(process.env.X)"` to verify (a) `GEMINI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true` propagates to children, (b) test isolation works (unset stays unset), (c) propagation is generic across arbitrary env vars. The sessionId-round-trip half of #32 is deferred — needs Gemini v0.39.1+ binary; mocking `--resume` would only re-test existing unit-test territory.
- [x] **#31 Codex `--ignore-user-config` + `--ignore-rules`** — Codex 0.124+ stabilized hooks; user-installed `~/.codex/config.toml` could potentially break our `--ephemeral` exec path with hook-error events. Preempted by adding both flags by default so the MCP wrapper is deterministic regardless of host machine codex config. Opt-out via `ASK_CODEX_LOAD_USER_CONFIG=1` for users with custom MCP servers registered in their codex config (mirrors the `ASK_GEMINI_REQUIRE_WORKSPACE_TRUST` opt-out from ADR-069). Auth credentials in `CODEX_HOME` always load. Closes #31, addresses action #5 from #26 / #24 / #25. ADR-071
- [x] **#30 Pipe large prompts via stdin** — Above 16 KiB the `@largefile` expansion + `/multi-review` / `/brainstorm` flows pushed argv close to ARG_MAX (256 KiB on macOS, 2 MiB on Linux). Fix: `executeCommand` accepts an optional 5th `stdin?: string` payload; both Gemini and Codex executors flip to stdin above `EXECUTION.STDIN_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (16 KiB). Gemini passes empty `-p ""` since headless mode requires the flag; Codex omits the positional argv entirely (its CLI reads from stdin when no prompt is given). Bonus: keeps full prompts out of `ps` output. ADR-070
- [x] **#26 Gemini CLI v0.39.1 workspace-trust gate** — gemini-cli v0.39.1 added `FatalUntrustedWorkspaceError` to headless (`-p`) mode, breaking fresh installs in directories never marked trusted. Fix: `geminiExecutor` sets `GEMINI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true` by default (forward-compatible env var, ignored on older Geminis); opt-out via `ASK_GEMINI_REQUIRE_WORKSPACE_TRUST=1`. Trust errors short-circuit before the Flash retry (same dir would just fail again) and surface a friendly remediation message. ADR-069
- [x] **npm 9 EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL workspace:*** — `npx -y ask-llm-mcp` failed under Claude Desktop's Node 18 / npm 9.7.1. Root cause + fix in ADR-052; lifecycle corrected in 1.5.7 / 0.2.7
- [x] **MCP Registry publish failures** — `server.json` versions were all set to the gemini tag version, causing 404 validation errors for codex/ollama/llm on the MCP registry. Fixed by reading each package's own `package.json` version
- [x] **Smoke test rate-limit-self-defeating loop** — Pre-push smoke tests burned the very Gemini quota the next push needed, causing intermittent push failures within ~10-minute windows. Added quota-detection escape (`scripts/smoke-test.sh`) that treats 429/quota errors as skip-with-warning, with `FORCE_SMOKE=1` opt-in to restore hard-fail (ADR-051)
- [x] **#23 brainstorm-coordinator** — Sub-agent background job lifecycle bug: Codex at high reasoning was SIGKILLed silently when the coordinator's turn ended. Rewrote Phase 3 to run sequentially (3B then 3A) with a single foreground blocking Bash dispatch using direct backgrounding + per-PID wait + 10-minute timeout (ADR-050)
- [x] **#22 brainstorm-coordinator** — Claude Opus as first-class research participant (Phase 3B), not just orchestrator; verified findings weighted higher than inferred (ADR-049)
- [x] **#21 Gemini fallback** — Multi-pattern quota detection for newer CLI versions (ADR-044)
- [x] **#20 Claude Desktop timeout** — Lowered default timeout to 210s, actionable error messages (ADR-045)
- [x] **ANT-242 Codex hangs + Node detection** — Added `--full-auto` flag, Node.js v20+ startup check (ADR-046)
- [x] **Shell PATH resolution** — macOS GUI apps (Claude Desktop) don't inherit shell PATH; added login shell extraction + heuristic fallback (ADR-047)

## Priority 10: MCP Best Practices & Plugin Quality
- [x] **Input validation** — `.max(100000)` on all prompt schemas, `path.isAbsolute()` on includeDirs (ADR-048 implied)
- [x] **LLM-actionable errors** — `sanitizeErrorForLLM()` replaces raw stack traces with guidance
- [x] **Test coverage** — 20 new tests for progressTracker, shellPath, sanitizeErrorForLLM (176→199)
- [x] **Plugin hooks** — Extracted to shell scripts, configurable timeout, PATH resolution
- [x] **Agent tool restrictions** — Reviewers limited to Bash/Glob/Grep/Read + provider MCP
- [x] **Skill trigger phrases** — Descriptions include invocation patterns for auto-matching

## Undecided / Potential Improvements
- **Streaming JSON output** — expose `--output-format stream-json` for real-time JSONL progress events (`init`, `message`, `tool_use`, `result`). Would replace keepalive messages with live content streaming. Now available in Gemini CLI 0.37.0.
- **Gemini `--approval-mode`** — New in 0.37.0: `default`, `auto_edit`, `yolo`, `plan`. Could use in hooks for safer non-interactive mode.
- **MCP `outputSchema`** — Structured responses via `structuredContent`. SDK supports it but clients may not handle it yet. Deferred.
- ~~**Extract tool registration loop**~~ — Done (ADR-053). Shared `registerTools()` in `@ask-llm/shared/serverFactory.ts`. ~130 lines eliminated. (`createSandboxServer()` later removed in ADR-054.)

## Priority 11: Session Usage Tracking & Smithery Removal (ADR-054)
- [x] **Session usage accumulator** — `@ask-llm/shared/usage.ts` with `UsageStats`, `SessionUsage`, `formatUsageStats`, `formatSessionUsage` (16 unit tests)
- [x] **Per-executor `UsageStats`** — Gemini, Codex, Ollama executors now return structured token + duration + fallback data alongside the response string
- [x] **`onUsage` callback** — `UnifiedTool.execute` and `executeTool` thread an optional usage callback; `registerTools` records into a per-server `SessionUsage` accumulator
- [x] **`get-usage-stats` MCP tool** — first-class `UnifiedTool` via `createUsageStatsTool(sessionUsage)` factory. Exposed by all 4 servers (Gemini 4→5 tools, Codex/Ollama/orchestrator 2→3 tools)
- [x] **Multi-review caught ADR contradiction** — Codex flagged that the original `registerUsageStatsTool` helper bypassed the registry, contradicting ADR-004/029/034 tool-count claims AND diverging from the sandbox-scanned schema (ADR-017). Fix: promoted to first-class tool via factory + registry path
- [x] **Smithery removal** — `createSandboxServer` infrastructure deleted from shared + all 3 provider `index.ts` files. Smithery was never adopted (skipped per "requires paid plan for stdio servers"); the abstraction was dead code formalized by ADR-053. ADR-017 superseded
- [x] **MCP `outputSchema` on `get-usage-stats`** — `UnifiedTool` extended with optional `outputSchema` and `ToolResult = string | {text, structuredContent}` return type. The usage tool now emits both markdown and a Zod-validated `SessionUsageSnapshot` for programmatic consumers (ADR-055)
- [x] **MCP Resource `usage://current-session`** — Live JSON snapshot exposed as a `resources/read` target via `registerSessionUsageResource` helper. Costs zero against the tool-token budget (ADR-029) since Resources sit in a separate namespace

## Priority 12: Doctor / Diagnostic Surface (ADR-056)
- [x] **Shared `runDiagnostics()` core** — `@ask-llm/shared/doctor.ts` with `DiagnosticReport`, per-check status, env + provider probe, formatter (16 unit tests)
- [x] **`npx ask-llm-mcp doctor` CLI subcommand** — works when MCP server can't start; `--json` flag for machine output; exit code 0 on ok/warning, 1 on error
- [x] **`diagnose` MCP tool on orchestrator** — 4th tool on `ask-llm-mcp`, structured `outputSchema` matching `DiagnosticReport`. Per-provider servers intentionally excluded (would only see their own provider)
- [x] **Smoke-tested live** — detects Node v24.13.0, 52 PATH entries, gemini 0.37.0, codex-cli 0.118.0, Ollama endpoint reachable

## Priority 13: Streaming Output for Gemini (ADR-057)
- [x] **`--output-format stream-json`** — Gemini CLI 0.37+ emits JSONL events; executor now uses this instead of buffered `--output-format json`
- [x] **Live progressive content** — `makeStreamingProgressForwarder` extracts assistant message deltas from the JSONL stream and forwards them to the existing `onProgress` callback. MCP clients now display the model's prose unfolding in real time inside progress notifications
- [x] **`parseGeminiStreamJsonl`** — Aggregates stream events into the same `GeminiExecutorResult` shape (sessionId, response, usage stats). Stream stats format converted to canonical `GeminiCliStats` shape via small adapter
- [x] **Backward-compat fallback** — Detects pre-0.37 Gemini output and falls back to legacy `parseGeminiJsonOutput`; existing tests using `JSON.stringify({response:...})` mocks continue to pass via this path
- [ ] **Codex streaming** — Deferred to future ADR (Codex JSONL parses already, just needs progressive consumption)
- [ ] **Ollama streaming** — Deferred to future ADR (HTTP `stream: true` body iteration)

## Priority 14: Session Continuity Across All Providers (ADR-058)
- [x] **Shared sessions store** — `@ask-llm/shared/sessions.ts` mirrors chunkCache pattern: 24h TTL, 200-file cap, 40-message cap, `isSafeSessionId` regex blocks path traversal (18 tests)
- [x] **Codex native resume** — `codex exec resume <id> <prompt>` wired via `buildArgs(prompt, model, sessionId)`; the existing `thread.started` event capture surfaces the resumable id automatically
- [x] **Ollama server-side replay** — `buildPriorMessages(id)` + `appendAndSaveSession()` maintain conversation history client-side; full message array sent on each turn, response footer includes `[Session ID: <id>]`
- [x] **Re-added `sessionId` to all 4 tool schemas** — partial reversal of ADR-034's sessionId removal (intent preserved: optional param, clearly described). Orchestrator's `ExecutorFn` routes to native or replay path per provider
- [x] **Cache disabled when sessionId is set** — same prompt in different conversations should yield different answers

## Priority 15: Plugin Test Coverage (ADR-059)
- [x] **Vitest added to plugin** — Replaces `"test": "echo 'No tests yet'"`. 57 new tests in 4 files
- [x] **Manifest validation** — `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, `hooks.json` shapes; bin entries point to existing files
- [x] **Skill + agent frontmatter validation** — Every skill's `name`/`description`, every agent's `name`/`description`/`model`/`color`; reviewer agents restricted from edit/write tools (over-privilege check)
- [x] **brainstorm-coordinator regression coverage** — Tests assert the load-bearing sections from ADR-049 (Phase 3A/3B sequential structure, WebFetch+WebSearch tools) and ADR-050 (sub-agent background-job warning, blocking-foreground language)
- [x] **pre-commit script safety patterns** — `set -euo pipefail`, secret pathspec exclusions, `trap` cleanup (ADR-040), `mktemp` use, PATH resolution (ADR-047), executable bit. Each maps to a documented historical bug
- [x] **Minimal frontmatter parser** — `_helpers.ts` provides `parseMarkdownFrontmatter()` inline (~30 lines) — avoided pulling a YAML dep for what is fundamentally a regression-protection layer

## Priority 16: `/compare` Skill — Side-by-Side Provider Responses (ADR-060)
- [x] **New skill** — `packages/claude-plugin/skills/compare/SKILL.md`, user-invocable, no agent
- [x] **Reuses ADR-050 dispatch pattern** — single foreground Bash call, direct backgrounding, per-PID wait, 10-minute timeout. Dispatches via plugin `dist/*-run.js` binaries (proper stdin + quota fallback)
- [x] **Synthesis-rejection** — skill body explicitly forbids paraphrasing or adjudicating; differentiated from `/brainstorm` (which synthesizes) and `/multi-review` (which validates code reviews)
- [x] **Test coverage** — 7 dedicated tests assert load-bearing structure (dispatch pattern, anti-pattern warnings, timeout requirement, dist/ runner usage); existing it.each gives the standard frontmatter coverage
- [x] **Docs updated** — Root README, plugin README, docs site overview all list `/compare`

## ~~Priority 17: GitHub Action — Multi-Provider Review in CI (ADR-061)~~
**Withdrawn 2026-04-17** — strategic refocus to CLI/agentic workflows; CI integration deferred indefinitely. A `/multi-review` pass against the implementation caught a critical ESM path-resolution bug in `runner.mjs`, and the broader decision to deprioritize CI integration in favor of CLI-driven agentic development meant the action was removed rather than fixed. Files deleted: `.github/actions/review/` and `packages/claude-plugin/src/__tests__/github-action.test.ts`. Work is preserved in git history. See ADR-061 (Withdrawn) for the path-resolution lesson if anyone revives this.

# Strategic focus: MCP tools + Claude Code plugin

The CLI/agentic exploration was scoped intentionally. The REPL (Priority 18 below) shipped as a working feature but is **scope-capped at its current state** — it serves as a maintainer dev tool and a minimal multi-provider differentiator, but is NOT being grown into a competitor to `claude` / `gemini` / `codex` CLIs. Future engineering effort goes into the MCP tool surface and the Claude Code plugin, where user energy is actually showing up.

## Priority 18: Interactive CLI REPL (ADR-062) — SCOPE-CAPPED
- [x] **`npx ask-llm-mcp repl` subcommand** — Joins `doctor` and the default server-start path in `cli.ts`
- [x] **Per-provider session map** — Switching providers picks up that provider's last session (Gemini `--resume`, Codex `exec resume`, Ollama server-side replay all flow through the same code path)
- [x] **Slash commands** — `/help`, `/provider`, `/providers`, `/new`, `/session`, `/sessions`, `/usage`, `/clear`, `/quit`. All pure-function-tested
- [x] **Live streaming** — `onProgress` chunks from Gemini stream-json (ADR-057) write deltas directly to stdout
- [x] **Live usage tracking** — `/usage` shows `formatSessionUsage` snapshot from ADR-054
- [x] **End-to-end smoke-tested** — `printf "/help\n/quit" | node dist/cli.js repl` works against real provider detection
- [x] **29 new tests** — covering every slash command path, state mutations, and `dispatchPrompt` happy/error/streaming paths
- ⊘ **No further investment planned**. Multi-line input, persistent sessions across invocations, `@file` syntax, history navigation, syntax highlighting — all explicitly out of scope. Use `claude` / `gemini` / `codex` / Claude Code for richer terminal UX. Use the REPL specifically for multi-provider switching from one shell.

## Priority 23: `/codex-verify` skill + `codex-verifier` agent (ADR-073)
- [x] **New `codex-verifier` agent** at `packages/claude-plugin/agents/codex-verifier.md` — read-only tool surface (Bash/Glob/Grep/Read + mcp__codex__ask-codex; no Write/Edit), atomic claim decomposition, five-grade CONFIDENCE ladder (`PERFECT | VERIFIED | PARTIAL | FEEDBACK | FAILED`), Report block contract
- [x] **New `/codex-verify` skill** at `packages/claude-plugin/skills/codex-verify/SKILL.md` — gathers diff + assistant's last message verbatim, dispatches the agent, **defensively parses** the Report block (derives missing CONFIDENCE from STATUS, mirrors Pi's `verifier.ts:1029-1049`), surfaces PARTIAL gaps loudly as templates for future fixtures
- [x] **`/multi-review` skill update** — added "Two kinds of verification — pick the right skill" callout with intent → skill table so users routing "did the assistant do what it claimed?" land on `/codex-verify` rather than spending a multi-provider dispatch
- [x] **No MCP server changes** — value lives entirely in agent + skill prose contracts; published packages untouched
- [x] **Same-day follow-on: synthesis-confidence on `brainstorm-coordinator`** — Phase 4 now grades the whole brainstorm with a four-level ladder (`PERFECT | VERIFIED | PARTIAL | FAILED`); FEEDBACK is explicitly dropped because brainstorming has no fix-loop semantic. Surfaced as the first line of the output. `/codex-image` was deliberately not extended — its Phase 4 already verifies via `ls -la` against the filesystem and the ladder doesn't fit a binary present/absent surface
- [ ] **Future:** parallel `gemini-verifier` once a constraining-prompt experiment shows Gemini can return parseable single-line verdicts; optional cross-validator pass (verify the verifier with the other provider); `.claude/verification-audits/<date>.json` audit log; auto-trigger via Claude Code Stop hook (defaults debate worth having separately)

## Priority 22: `multi-llm` MCP tool (ADR-066)
- [x] **New `packages/llm-mcp/src/multiLlm.ts`** — `dispatchMultiLlm`, `formatMultiLlmReport`, `buildMultiLlmInputSchema`, schema definitions
- [x] **Orchestrator-only tool** — registered inline as the 5th MCP tool on `ask-llm-mcp` (was 4); per-provider servers don't get it (they only have one executor)
- [x] **Promise.all parallelism** — not Bash dispatch; the MCP tool handler runs in the persistent server process so ADR-050's sub-agent lifecycle concern doesn't apply
- [x] **Per-provider failure isolation** — one provider's exception/timeout doesn't fail the whole call; `results[i].ok=false` with error message; consumer decides what to do
- [x] **Structured outputSchema** — `MultiLlmReport` shape with `dispatchedAt`, `totalDurationMs`, `successCount`, `failureCount`, per-result `{provider, ok, response?, model?, sessionId?, usage?, durationMs, error?}`
- [x] **Coexists with `/compare` skill** — different audiences (skill is Claude Code-only with Claude verification; tool is any-MCP-client with raw structured)
- [x] **15 new tests** — happy path, usage callback, throws/missing handling, threadId fallback, parallelism timing, schema round-trip, formatter rendering, input schema validation
- [ ] **Future**: per-provider sessionId continuity, per-provider model override, early-termination ("any N of M complete"), streaming the merged report

## Priority 21: `outputSchema` on `ask-*` tools (ADR-065)
- [x] **Canonical `AskResponse` shape** in `@ask-llm/shared/askResponse.ts` — `{ provider, response, model, sessionId?, usage? }` with Zod validation
- [x] **`response` field is raw model text only** (no footer/prefix) — formatted text in `content[0].text` keeps backward-compat
- [x] **Unified `sessionId` field across providers** — Codex's threadId and Gemini's sessionId both map here; clients can resume any provider with one field
- [x] **All 4 free-form ask-* tools updated** — `ask-gemini`, `ask-codex`, `ask-ollama`, `ask-llm` (orchestrator). Each gains outputSchema + structured execute return
- [x] **`ask-gemini-edit` deferred** — its output shape (changeMode edit blocks) is fundamentally different; deserves its own `editResponseSchema` in a follow-up
- [x] **7 new schema validation tests** — all 3 providers accepted, unknown rejected, optional fields work, malformed usage rejected
- [x] **Backward compat preserved** — `content[0].text` unchanged; `structuredContent` purely additive

## Priority 20: Skill polish for /multi-review and /brainstorm (ADR-064)
- [x] **Diff preprocessing** — `git add -N` for untracked, pathspec exclusion of docs/binaries/lockfiles, 3-tier size policy (<50KB / 50–150KB warn / >150KB ask)
- [x] **Per-finding verification** — Phase 3 of /multi-review now requires Read-based source verification of every >=80 confidence finding; classifies as VERIFIED / REJECTED / UNVERIFIABLE. Built specifically to catch the 2026-04-17 case where Gemini returned two 95/100 false positives
- [x] **Fallback dispatch** — when reviewer agents aren't available, skill instructs Claude to use the project's `dist/run.js` / `dist/codex-run.js` runners with the ADR-050 pattern; explicitly forbids raw `gemini -p` / `codex exec` (would bypass quota fallback + stdin handling + PATH resolution)
- [x] **Failure resilience** — failed providers surface inline with stderr instead of silently dropping; partial results are explicit
- [x] **brainstorm-coordinator Phase 4 cross-check** — coordinator now spot-checks high-confidence external claims against source before promoting to consensus; new Rejected section in synthesis surfaces false positives
- [x] **16 new tests** — pin every load-bearing structural element across the three files so future edits can't silently regress the polish

## Priority 19: Session Continuity Hardening (ADR-063)
All three open issues from the 2026-04-17 multi-review are now fixed and tested:
- [x] **Codex `--ephemeral` only when no session is wanted** — `buildArgs` drops the flag when `sessionId` is set so resume actually persists. Cache key gate also moved to `wantsSession = sessionId !== undefined`
- [x] **Session file permissions hardened** — `0o700` on dir, `0o600` on files, atomic temp+rename write, lstat-based symlink rejection (defense-in-depth against tmp races)
- [x] **Ollama empty-string sessionId disables cache** — Documented "pass empty string to start a new session" UX path now works end-to-end. The downstream `appendAndSaveSession` already handled empty string correctly; only the cache short-circuit needed the fix
- [x] **10 new tests** — 4 in codex (ephemeral conditional, exec-resume sequence, empty-string cache), 4 in sessions (dir/file modes, retroactive tightening, no leftover tmp), 2 in ollama (undefined hits cache, empty bypasses)

## Candidate next directions (MCP/plugin)

After the open issues are fixed:
- **Provider routing intelligence in `ask-llm` tool** — Auto-pick provider per task type (code review → Codex, large-context → Gemini, private/fast → Ollama). The orchestrator's `provider` parameter becomes optional with a routing function as fallback
- **`/compare` and `/brainstorm` polish** — Apply lessons from real usage (the 2026-04-17 multi-review session showed both work but have rough edges around large diffs and timeout handling)
- **`outputSchema` on more tools** — Currently only `get-usage-stats` and `diagnose` have it. Adding to `ask-gemini`, `ask-codex`, `ask-ollama` would let MCP clients structurally extract sessionId, threadId, usage rather than parsing the response text
- **Subagent orchestration patterns as MCP** — Formalize the brainstorm-coordinator pattern as `spawn-subagent` + `wait-for-subagent` MCP tools instead of skill instructions. Lets any MCP client compose multi-agent workflows
- **Marketplace publish polish** — Better `/plugin install ask-llm` UX, version pinning guidance, upgrade story

- [x] **Version bump** — all packages bumped to next minor (gemini 1.5.0, others 0.2.0)

### Priority 1: Critical Fixes (all resolved)
- [x] Fix deprecated `-p` flag for Gemini CLI v0.23+ (upstream PRs #56, #43)
- [x] Fix exit code 42 on Gemini CLI v0.29.5+: revert to `-p` flag for non-interactive mode (ADR-015)
- [x] Windows compatibility: ENOENT spawn errors, `.cmd` handling (upstream PRs #23, #27, #41, #43)
- [x] Add process timeout to prevent indefinite hangs (5min default, `GMCPT_TIMEOUT_MS` env var)
- [x] Fix all utils/ audit issues (logger, commandExecutor, geminiExecutor, parsers, cache)

### Priority 3: Gemini CLI Parameter Expansion (all resolved)
- [x] **Structured JSON output** — pass `--output-format json` (ADR-019)
- [x] **Multi-turn session support** — expose `--resume <sessionId>` (ADR-021)
- [x] **Include additional directories** — expose `--include-directories <dirs>` (ADR-022)

- [x] ~~Fix excessive token responses for small prompts~~ (upstream Issues #6, #26) — Won't fix: root cause was `gemini-2.5-pro` model bug (always returned ~45k tokens); mitigated by changing default to `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Gemini CLI has no `--max-output-tokens` flag.
- [x] Add automated test suite (Vitest, 99 tests across 6 files, ADR-014)
- [x] Set up linter and formatter (Biome v2.4.4)

- [x] Add `labeled` trigger for `@claude` mentions on issue label events

### Priority 2: Claude Code Plugin (all resolved)

- [x] Create `/gemini-review` skill — on-demand Gemini consultation via agent delegation
- [x] ~~Add Stop hook — background Gemini review of session changes~~ **Removed (ADR-048)** — `Stop` event fired per-turn not per-session, and `git diff HEAD` missed untracked files. Use `/gemini-review` on demand instead.

- [x] Fix stale server name/version in `src/index.ts` — now reads from `package.json` at runtime
- [x] ~~Fix Smithery CJS bundling: `createSandboxServer()` export, separate CLI entry point (ADR-017)~~ — Smithery removed entirely in ADR-054 (no consumers; project distributes via npm + MCP Registry + Claude Code marketplace)
- [x] Fix `npx` bin resolution: renamed bin from `gemini-mcp` to `ask-gemini-mcp` to match package name
- [x] Prevent AI clients from using outdated models: updated tool/param descriptions
- [x] Expose thinking tokens in `formatStats` stats footer
- [x] Fix `extractJson` greedy first-match bug — now prefers Gemini-shaped JSON
- [x] Fix `extractJson` escape-outside-string bug — backslash escapes only inside JSON strings
