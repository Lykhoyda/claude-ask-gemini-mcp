# When the smoke test itself burns the very Gemini/Codex quota that the next
# push needs, we get a rate-limit-self-defeating loop: push N fails because
# pushes 1..N-1 consumed the window. Detect quota/rate-limit errors and treat
# them as skip-with-warning rather than a hard failure. Set FORCE_SMOKE=1 to
# disable the escape and require all smokes to pass regardless. See ADR-051.

# Live API calls occasionally fail with transient errors (network blips, brief
# 5xx, upstream-API hiccups) that succeed on retry. Default behavior: one
# silent retry on any non-quota failure with a 5s sleep between attempts.
# Quota errors get the immediate skip-with-warning above (retry won't help —
# quota exhaustion isn't transient). Set NO_SMOKE_RETRY=1 to disable retries
# and treat the first failure as final (useful for debugging real regressions).
